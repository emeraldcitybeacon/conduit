"""Utility helpers for Pulse permissions and role checks.

This module defines simple helper functions used throughout the Pulse
application to determine whether a user should have access to editor-only
or volunteer-level features.  These helpers rely on Django's built-in
``Group`` model so that membership can be managed via the admin or a
setup management command.

The module intentionally keeps the checks lightweight â€“ it does not hit the
database for anonymous users and recognises that superusers should always
be treated as editors.
